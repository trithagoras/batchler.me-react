      <p>
        Hi! I'm Corey and I'm a 22 year old full-time software engineer and 5th
        year (ugh) student studying Computer Science at QUT in Brisbane,
        Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        I originally did four years studying Computer Science at UQ but very
        gradually came to realise that I'm pretty terrible at the
        paper-examination format that UQ liberally uses, and found that QUT
        typically prefers large assignments (which are much more fun and
        absolutely easier to do).
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a shame because UQ certainly has the more theoretical CS degree
        while QUT prides itself on being "for the real world" (-_-) and I am
        absolutely fascinated by a lot of CS theory and the inevitable roots in
        mathematics. At UQ, I learned:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=COMP2048">Theory of Computing,</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=csse3100">Reasoning About Programs,</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=COMP3400">Functional &amp; Logic Programming,</a> and</li>
          <li><a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=COMP4403">Compilers and Interpreters</a></li>
        </ul>
        These were some of my absolute favourite courses and taught me a lot
        about programming theory such as different paradigms, proving program
        correctness, and how languages are designed - which led me to start my
        work on my own programming language, dFunc.
